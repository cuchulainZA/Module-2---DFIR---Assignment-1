The digital forensics landscape is dominated by various software vendors who
provide digital forensics software tools. Many have significant sales teams which
have pushed the narrative in the marketplace that their tools have been court
validated, and as such their tools should be trusted and used. This has created
a situation where much of digital forensics practice globally revolves around
the use of these tools, and that certification in the use of these tools has been
the standard approach to conducting digital forensics. Draft an academic essay
addressing the following:
     Whether, considering acceptable forensic science practice applied to the
    field of digital forensics, the claims by vendors of court validation" satisfy
    the scientific requirement of tool validity. Motivate your arguments.
     Does the domination of the digital forensics field by commercial digital
    forensic software hinder or benefit (or both) the practice of digital foren-
    sics?
Your report should be 8-10 pages long.

NOTE: While references are likely to be sparse in this document, the 
assessment will focus on the strength of argumentation and justification of your
decision making process.
