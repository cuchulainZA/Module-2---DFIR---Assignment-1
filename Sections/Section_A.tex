Hacking has been criminalized in many countries around the globe, including
South Africa. The Electronic Communications and Transaction Act 25 of 2002
was the first Act to create hacking crimes, and now the Cyber crime and 
Cyber security Bill plans to expand on that. Draft an academic essay (8-10 pages)
addressing the following issues:
     Identify to what extent existing South Africa and planned legislation com-
    pares to the Cyber crime legislation in the United States and Europe.
     Discuss whether the proposed Cyber crime and Cyber security Bill will im-
    prove the legislative ability to address hacking as a crime, and motivate
    your reasoning.
     Discuss areas that you feel where the proposed Cyber crime and Cyber 
    security Bill could have a negative impact on the cyber security profession,
    and motivate your reasoning.
Your discussion should be 8-10 pages long excluding references.
